<h1>Who Am I?</h1>

  <p>Nice to meet you! My name is Amaar Fazlani. I was born in Karachi, Pakistan and moved to the United States when I was four months old. Growing up, I always loved to watch and play basketball and my favorite team is the Houston Rockets. I also enjoy reading and love it when I find a book that is both entertaining and thought-provoking. I am a recent graduate from Davidson College. At Davidson, I achieved a B.A. in History and learned how to think critically about issues that were multifaceted in nature with no easy solution. I was constantly pushed to analyze information and data in depth in order to form concrete arguments backed by reliable sources. </p>

  <p>One quirk that I have is that I do not know how to swim. I always wanted to learn how to swim but both my parents never knew how to swim either. It is definetely on my to-do list and I hope that in a years time, I can proudly say that I have finally learned to swim. Perhaps one day, in the not too distant future, I can teach others who are in the same shoes as me.
