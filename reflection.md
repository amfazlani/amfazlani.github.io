What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

I used very basic CSS and was not able to fully implement the padding, borders, and margin CSS properties. I had a very difficult time with this challenge and it showed me that my knowledge of CSS is still very limited. I am going to be sure to attend office hours this week and get a better grasp of each of these.

What did you learn about CSS positioning?

With CSS positioning, I learned that it is very important to have a visual repersentation of your site first before you start to style it. When I realized how important a visual was in terms of positioning, I began to understand why wireframing is such a critical tool.

What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

The aspects of design that were the easiest for me was formatting the content (font-size, text-align to center, font-weight to bold) I really felt like I have a good grasp of how to style the actual bulk of my page which is the content. The hardest part was formatting my toolbars, my footers, and pretty much everything else that goes into creating a webpage. I really feel like I need to visit office hours because I do not think I have a good grasp of the other facets of CSS at this point.

What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?
I learned that it is very neccessary to write clean and understandable HTML code first before you can start CSS because it becomes very difficult if your HTML code is not formatted the way it should be. Simplicity here is everything. Because while CSS is very useful to make the webpage "look" the way it should, the HTML document is where the webpage is truly created and if the HTML is hard to read or understand the CSS will become even that much more difficult.
