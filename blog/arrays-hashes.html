<h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2>
<h3>October 27, 2015</h3>
<p>
  Arrays and Hashes are one of the fundamental building blocks of the programming language called Ruby. They are both used very often and it is critical to develop a fundamental understanding of both Arrays and Hashes if one is to begin to learn Ruby. In this blog, I will discuss key differences between Arrays and Hashes and explain through real-life examples, when you would use one over the other. Let's start with Arrays. Arrays are simply a collection of items. These items can be anything! They can be floats, integers, short strings, long strings, they can even be nil values. Arrays can also include more arrays! The flexibility in what can be put into an array is what makes arrays useful to use when there is a collection of a large amount of data, and sometimes this data may not come in the form of just numbers, or just strings, they may be a mixed combination of both. For example, let's say a company wanted to analyze a large amount of data (number of users, amount spent on their website, the amount spent on their website through different avenues) then this company's programmers can throw all the information into arrays, and then sort those arrays in any way they like by iterating over those arrays in a very specific and direct way.

  Hashes are just a little different. Why they are also very useful when collecting large amounts of data, they are less flexible than arrays in that they have specific key-value pairs. Every key that is defined is linked to every value that is defined. These keys cannot be used more than once, so it is very important to have a mental note of the keys that have been used. Hashes are very important when one wants to organize data in a way that is, in some way, related to other types of data. For example: movie names with the movie times, or song-titles, with how long the song is. In this way, Hashes can be more useful than arrays, because they automatically organize your information for you as long as you have the right key-value pairs. I hope that this blog post was able to provide a little information on the difference between arrays and hashes, as both of these are critical to the foundations of Ruby which is a very simple, but powerful language to learn.
