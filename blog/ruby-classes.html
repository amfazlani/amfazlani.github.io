<h1>Learning About Ruby Classes!</h1>
<h2>November 9, 2015</h2>
<p>
  In the real-world, every object performs a certain action. Without even realizing it, we perform hundreds of actions every single day! Take for example, humans. There is a wide range of common behaviors amongst humans such as eating, drinking, sleeping, crying, smiling. These all could be considered "actions" that the class Human performs. This is where instance methods come into play. Because we know that humans have a set of common behaviors or actions, we can create a class and input these actions into the class, and anytime there is a new instance of the Human class, for example a new baby that is born, this baby will share all of those attributes or behaviors. </p>
<p> Let's use a different example and consider the instance methods and instance variables as we go. Consider a professional NBA basketball player. What if we wanted to assign certain behaviors or actions to all basketball players such as jump or pass or dunk or shoot? We would need to create a class called Basketball_Player. We would then need to initialize the class so that we can have an argument that is passed in such as the name of the basketball player, their age, and their skill rating. Now that we have initialized the class with a method, we need to create specefic methods that display the action that is being performed. For example, the action of performing a dunk. By defining the method dunk and return a string that says "swoosh" we now have a method we could call on any instances of the Basketball_Player class.</p>
