<h1>Learning About Ruby on Rails!</h1>
<h2>November 24, 2015</h2>
<p>
Ruby on Rails was founded by David Heinemier Hansson on July 2004. First, lets discuss why Hansson chose Ruby to begin with. The story of Rails began when Hansson was trying to create Basecamp, and online project management application. In the process, Hannson quickly became tired and frustrated with using PHP, because the code was very repetetive and Hansson wanted a more clean, and less cluttered language to use. There are very few languages out there that are more easy to use and less cluttered than Ruby.</p>
<p>Now to the second question, why use Rails and what does it do? Ruby on Rails is used to build web applications. Making a web application could be very tiresome if one has to start completely from scratch. But with Ruby on Rails, there are built in methods and frameworks that make creating a complex site with multiple functions and databases much easier. The reason Rails is so powerful is because of its collaborative nature. Many call this the "Ruby way." When programmers create a website using Ruby on Rails they immediately become part of a much larger enviornment in which they could collaborate and build on their code and learn from other programmers that are using a similar framework. In addition to this collaborative nature, using Rails is a much more pleasant experience because it is backed by the Ruby language which is so easy to use. In conclusion, because Ruby on Rails gives programmers a very good starting point in creating their websites, along with the fact that it is an open and collaborative enviornment, makes it an ideal language to use when building web applications.
