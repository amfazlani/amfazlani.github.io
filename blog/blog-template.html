    How was it to wireframe and create an HTML page with a pair?

    It was very informative to see how another person went through the same process of creating a wireframe and them implementing that wireframe into a working html page. I learned that there is no one right way to go about this process, as some use sketches by hand and others use tools. Some make very descriptive wireframes and others could work just fine with a general outline. My pair used a hand-drawn sketch and it seemed to be the best method for him. I used a wireframe tool and I could see the pros and cons for both. With hand-drawn sketches it is very easy to add creative elements that my not neccessarily be offered in a tool.

    Did you find wireframing to be helpful to your development process?

    I defeintely saw why making wireframes is so important to the development process. Once I had completed my wireframe, all I needed to do was figure out the neccessary tags as I already knew beforehand what type of content I wanted to include and where. This made creating the actual html file much easier as it was more like arranging the pieces of a puzzle only I already knew where the pieces were going to be.

    What did you and your pair decide made a good wireframe?

    We both decided that a good wireframe is different for everyone. What may seem like a very good wireframe to me may not seem that way to someone else because the way in which we plan and organize is completely different. To use an analogy, being a college student I saw that everyone reviewed for tests in their own seperate way. Some used review sheets, others studied straight out of the book, and some students created very general outlines that helped them prepare for the exam. To me, wireframes work the same way. Some people may want their wireframes to show exactly how their website will look, others may simply use it as a tool to understand how their website will navigate and which information to include and some may use a mixture of both of these strategies.

    What new semantic elements did you learn about (if any) ?

    The biggest semantic element I learned was the <nav> tag. Previously I thought you could just include whatever specific tag you wanted in your body such as <ul> or <p> but I have now learned it is helpful to use more general tags like <nav> before using these specific tags to understand what those tags will be doing which will make your code easier to understand.
