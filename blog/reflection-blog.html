<h1>Reflecting on Building a Website</h1>
<h2>November 30, 2015</h2>
<p>
In this blog post, I will talk a little bit about my experience in building my personal website. I would have to say, at first, I was very intimidated at the idea of creating my own personal website because I did not really have much experience in designing websites before. I also was having a difficult time with CSS which made creating a website even more intimidating. But after having made a website, although it is still very basic, I feel more confident in my ability to plan and build a website from scratch.

  I have really liked the fact that there are numerous tools that we can use to make a website that is both personal and professional. As the onsite portion begins, I am very eager to build on the CSS knowledge I have and make more changes to my website as I become more comfortable writing CSS. The most challenging aspect of this exercise in making a website was picking up CSS. I had a difficult time getting used to CSS and I am not entirely sure the reason for this. It may be because of that fact that there are so many options to choose from that I sometimes get mixed up with the functions of each different property. The most rewarding aspect of making a website was going to my URL and knowing that I had made this website completely from scratch which is a very amazing feeling. Overall, I would say that I enjoyed making my own website and hope to build on my existing knowledge to make it more dynamic and unique in the next few weeks.
