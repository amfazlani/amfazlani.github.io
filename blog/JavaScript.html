<h1>The Small But Important Differences Between Ruby and Javascript</h1>
<h2>November 16, 2015</h2>
<p>
There are numerous differences between Javascript and Ruby and it would take someone an entire day to outline every difference. But which ones are the biggest? Which ones are those that throw you off? In this blog, I will try to talk about a few cases in which I struggled with adjusting with Javascript after using Ruby first.
</p>
<p>
  First is the syntax. There are huge differences between Ruby syntax and Javascript syntax. In Ruby, most times you will be working with parenthesis (). But in Javascript almost everything starts with brackets {}. For this reason, one must become very comfortable with being aware of the number of brackets that are open along with the parenthesis as this could become very confusing if you are not paying attention to detail. Second, when you assign a variable in Javascript, unlike Ruby you do not simply state the name of the variable with an equal sign. Rather, you must use the key word var. For me, it was easy to remember because I just thought of variables like methods in Ruby. Everytime, you create a method you use the keyword def. Now on to methods, or in Javascript, functions. Unlike Ruby you do not create a function using def, rather you have a few different options. You can use the keyword var followed by the keyword function and then the arguments. This is the method I used as it just seemed a little more similar to Ruby. In conclusion, when learning Javascript, after learning Ruby, one must pay attention to detail, as this could be the most important factor in making a smooth transition.
