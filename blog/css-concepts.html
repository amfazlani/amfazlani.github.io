<h2>What is Positioning in CSS? What Are the Differences?</h2>
<h3>October 19, 2015</h3>
<p>
Positioning is very important when it comes to creating a webpage. The reason for this is because each different webpage has a multitude of different elements. Most webpages these days have content, banners, toolbars, etc. Because of how dynamic webpages have become in the 21st century, it is more neccessary than ever to have a strong grasp of how to position elements in a webpage and how to differentiate between the different positions. The four main positions used in CSS are static, absolute, fixed, and relative.

  In this blog post, I will do my best to explain the different positions. Static positions are the default positions, meaning that they act normally without any additional properties or preferences. When you scroll down in a webpage, a static element will act just as how your content will act, it will go up or down depending on how you scroll. Fixed positions are used when you wish for an element to not move when you are scrolling through the page, and this type of positioning is most commonly used for sidebars, toolbars,etc. With fixed positioning, it makes navigating easier when your navigation bars are present throughout your experience on a webpage. Absolute positioning is used when you want to place a certain element in the exact position on the web page that you wish. By adjusting the other properties such as top margin, bottom margin, etc. you can use absolute to place the element in the exact place that you need.Relative positioning is the one type of position that most people have the most trouble with. It is a position which sets the specific element in a position relative to itself. This means that if certain attributes are set in a certain way, the element will be adjust relative to itself. In describing all four positions, I hope that I was able to make this concept easier to understand.
